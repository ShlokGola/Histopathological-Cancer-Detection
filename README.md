This was my final Masters prjocts on Histopathological Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Cancer Detection. 
The three convolutional neural networks are considered in this project to classify cancerous tissues and non-cancerous tissues. One CNN model is designed from scratch and two pre-trained models, 
i.e., ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 are used to analyze histopathology images for cancer detection. Moreover, different gradient descent optimization algorithms Adam, Adagrad and Nadam are used to analyze 
their effects on diagnosis accuracy.

The data set that is used for this project is sourced from the online platform Kaggle.

In this project I have used only train set and train_labels as I didn't have test labels given to verify
those for models evalution that we used. So, the train set and train_labels are split in train and text randomly.

I have also uploaded the project report and presentation in the repository. The code is divided in three files for different gradient descent.
